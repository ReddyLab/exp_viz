# Experiment Coverage Visualization

This library reads data generated by https://github.com/ReddyLab/cov_viz and filters it based on parameters passed in by the experiment_coverage view (cegs_portal/search/views/v1/experiment_coverage.py)

It is written in Rust using the maturin and pyo3 libraries:

- [maturin](https://maturin.rs/)
- [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/)
